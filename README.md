## Background

This strategy was developed in my master thesis, "*Development of an Image-Based Gripping Strategy for Cooperative Object Transport using Mobile Robots*" in [match](https://www.match.uni-hannover.de/). As a preliminary project of cooperative object transport using several mobile robots, this thesis focuses on the transportation of an aluminium profile by the cooperation of one mobile robot and a passive flatbed trolley. The proposed strategy can help the robot autonomously accomplish the transport task of an object whose weight is beyond the maximum payload of the robot arm. For a successful demostrationï¼Œplease click the link: https://youtu.be/GOlom8Huy4w.

## Introduction
### Task
The strategy can guide a mobile robot through five steps in object transport:
1. detect the object to be transported
2. obtain its depth information
3. estimate 6D-pose of the object
4. plan a procedure to carry the object
5. execute the procedure.

### Robot
The MuR205 Robot is composed of a camera, a robot arm, a gripper, a mobile platform, and a computer. It combines the capabilities of a depth camera (Intel RealSense Depth Camera D435), a 6-axis lightweight robot arm (UR5), and a gripper (OnRobot RG2) as well as a mobile platform (MiR200).

### Framework
Components of the robot communicate with each other via ROS. The programs ([/scripts](https://github.com/BlackieCen/murc_robot/tree/master/scripts)) are written in Python. In ROS, the components can share their states. As the following node diagram shows, the groups represent the camera, robot arm, and platform, respectively. The camera provides the images. The position of the profile results from the image processing. Then the components are allowed to detect the position of the aluminium profile and approach to, grip, or deposit the aluminium profile accordingly. The operator can remotely run programs and control the robot in a laptop because the PC in robot shares the ros-master with the laptop via SSH. The operator can also monitor the detected profile and the gripping process on a laptop.

## Configurations in Hardware
Before running programs, the hardware is supposed to be configured.

0. update of URCap from 1.0.1 to 1.10.1 (if an error "missing URCap" comes up, do this step):  
   robot setting-- URcaps-- "+" -- open *OnRobot/RG2-1.10.1_0/OnRobot-1.10.1.urcap*-- restart
1. load installation file (*murc.installation*) in teach pendant of UR5, then restart UR5
2. adjust tcp-coordinate system:  
   installation-- RG configuration-- rotate the gripper twice in GUI, then RZ becomes 0.
3. load placing program:  
   program-- load program-- open */programms/Cen/Placing.urp*

## Usage
1. run MiR driver in PC:  
   ```sh
   roslaunch mir_driver mir.launch
   ```
2. run MiR navigation (Rviz) in Laptop:  
   ```sh
   roslaunch mir_navigation mir_start.launch
   ```
3. run object detection program in PC, inclding camera driver and ur driver as well as serveral servers for object detection, transformation between different coordinate frames and components controlling:  
   ```sh
   roslaunch murc_robot object_detector.py
   ```
   if neccessary, run drivers separately
   ```sh
   roslaunch realsense2_camera rs_aligned_depth848x480.launch # camera driver
   roslaunch ur_modern_driver ur5_bringup.launch robot_ip:=192.168.12.90 # ur driver
   ```
4. visualization of camera view und the result of objetdetection in Laptop:  
   ```sh
   rosrun murc_robot img_displayer.py
   ```
5. monitor current gripping process in state machine in Laptop:  
   ```sh
   rosrun smach_viewer smach_viewer.py
   ```
6. launch gripping state machine:  
   ```sh
   rosrun murc_robot imagebased_grasping_smach4.py
   ```

## Package Overview

Package | Description
------------- | -------------
mir_driver    |   The mir driver provides most of the important topics and functionalities for either Odometry or SLAM navigation, including the move_base action server, which can be used to execute goal requests. 
realsense2_camera     | This camera driver can stream all camera sensors and publish on the appropriate ROS topics.
ur_modern_driver | Updated version of ur_driver. Needed for communication with robot controller using *ur_srcipt* messages. The arm can be used in different modes: movel, movej, speedl, speedj.
